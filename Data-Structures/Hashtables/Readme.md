# Hashtable

An implementation of a hashtable

## Challenge

Implement a hashtable which should be able to handle the following:

- Add an item to a hashtable.(Method name: Add(key, value))
- Get a value from a key (Method name: Find(key))
- Make a hashing algorithm that will determine and set the Key of your Key/Value Pair(Method Name: GetHash(key))
- Handle collisions in the event that 2 keys equal the same

Test the following:

- Insertion
- Contanins
- 2 tests for collisions
