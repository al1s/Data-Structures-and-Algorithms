# Stack and Queue

Implementation of a stack and a queue

## Challenge

Implement a Stack and a Queue. Your Stack should meet the following criteria:

- O(1) - .Push(Node node) - Add a node to the stack
- O(1) - .Pop() - removes and return the top node of the stack
- O(1) - .Peek() - returns the top node of the stack.

Queue should meet the following criteria:

- O(1) - .Enqueue(Node node) - Add a node to the queue
- O(1) - .Dequeue() - removes and return the front node of the queue
- O(1) - .Peek() - returns the front node of the queue.

Test the following conditions:

- Pushing a node onto your stack
- Popping a node off your stack
- Peeking at the top node of your stack
- Enqueue a node into your queue
- Dequeue a node off of your queue
- Peek at the front of your queue.
