  - Bring in both the parent node, and the new node to be added
- GetNodes()
  - returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection
- GetNeighbors()
  - returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
  - Bring in a given node
  - Include the weight from the given node.
- Size()
  - returns the total number of nodes in the graph

Test the following conditions:
