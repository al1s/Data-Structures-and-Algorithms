# Reverse singly linked list
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A function to reverse a Singly Linked List for Code 401.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The method should take in 1 parameter: a linked lists as arguments. Should return and do in-place reversing of elements.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(N);
* Space: O(1);

We iterate through an initial linked list element by element to reconfigure them into resulting linked list, so the time is O(N). 
We don't create a new data structures so the space is O(1).
