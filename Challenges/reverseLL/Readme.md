# Check singly linked list for palindrome
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
A function to validate whether or not a Linked list is palindrome for Code 401.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The method should take in 1 parameter: a linked lists as arguments. Should return true or false depending whether the linked list is or isn't a palindrome.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(N);
* Space: O(N);

We iterate through an initial linked list element by element to reconfigure them into resulting linked list, so the time is O(N). 
We create a new data structures so the space is O(N).
