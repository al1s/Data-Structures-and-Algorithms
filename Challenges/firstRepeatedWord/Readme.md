# Unique Characters in a sentence
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This is an implementation of CheckUniqueChars function for a Code 401.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function to check whether all chars in a given sentence are unique. Return a boolean.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(n);
* Space: O(n);

We're traversing all words/chars in the string, so time is O(n). 
We are using additional data-structure (hashtable) to store the content of the string, so the space is O(n).
