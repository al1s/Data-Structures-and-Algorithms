# Graph - get edges
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
This is an implementation of checking the straight route exists between graph vertices for Code 401.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function which takes in 2 parameters: a graph and the an array with a vertices' names. It returns true if the route exists and the full cost of it. 

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(N);
* Space: O(1);

We're traversing a graph, so time is O(N). We don't create a new data structures so the space is O(1).
