# Insert and shift middle index of array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Insert and shift an array in middle at index

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(n);
* Space: O(n);

We iterate over initial array copying every element to a new array, so time is O(n). We create a new array so the space is O(n).
