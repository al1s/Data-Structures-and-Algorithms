<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Insert and shift an array in middle at index

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value

## Approach & Efficiency

* Time: O(n);
* Space: O(1);

We traverse over initial tree an element by an element, so time is O(n). We don't create a new array so the space is O(1).
